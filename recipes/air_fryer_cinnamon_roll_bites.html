    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Serve these air fryer cinnamon roll bites to your family, and you'll see smiles all around the table. They’re kid-sized and just a fun way to serve cinnamon rolls. Refrigerated cinnamon rolls are cut into bites, air fried, tossed in cinnamon sugar, and served with an orange-flavored creamy dip.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12.4 ounce) can refrigerated cinnamon rolls (such as Pillsbury™)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>
        <li>3/4 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon freshly grated orange peel</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon orange juice</li>
        <li>icing from the cinnamon roll package</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an air fryer to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Add sugar and cinnamon to a large resealable plastic bag, and shake to combine.</li>
        <li>Remove the 8 cinnamon rolls from the can, and set icing aside. Cut each roll into 4 equal pieces for a total of 32 bites.</li>
        <li>Line the fryer basket with parchment paper. Place the bites in a single layer in the bottom of the basket, cook for 3 minutes, turn over using tongs, and cook until golden brown, another 2 to 3 minutes. Depending on the brand and size of your air fryer, you may have to cook in batches, and your timing may vary, so watch closely.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, prepare the dip. Add cream cheese, confectioner’s sugar, orange zest, orange juice, and the packaged icing to a small bowl. Beat with an electric mixer on medium speed until you reach a dipping consistency, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Drop the warm pieces into the sugar-cinnamon mixture, and shake. Transfer to a plate or basket, and serve with the dip.</li>
    </ol>
